### INTRODUCTION

### DATASET SUMMARY

The dataset automobile.txt provides a comprehensive overview of automobile characteristics, encompassing a variety of features that detail both the physical specifications and performance metrics of vehicles. This dataset is well-suited for analyses focused on understanding trends in automobile manufacturing, evaluating performance attributes, and exploring relationships between vehicle characteristics and pricing.

The dataset contains 26 columns, each representing a specific attribute of an automobile. These attributes can be broadly classified into descriptive, dimensional, mechanical, and performance-related categories. The make, fuel-type, and aspiration columns provide categorical data about the manufacturer and design features, such as whether the car uses petrol or diesel fuel and the type of aspiration (e.g., turbocharged or naturally aspirated). The num-of-doors and body-style columns describe the vehicle's structure and design, while drive-wheels and engine-location offer insights into the drivetrain and engine placement, such as front- or rear-wheel drive.

Attributes like wheel-base, length, width, height, and curb-weight define the vehicle's physical dimensions and weight. These features are essential for analyzing vehicle design trends and their correlation with performance or market preferences. The dataset delves into technical specifications through columns such as engine-type, num-of-cylinders, engine-size, and fuel-system. These variables describe the core mechanics of the vehicle, including engine design and fuel delivery mechanisms. Bore, stroke, and compression-ratio add another layer of detail by describing the engine's internal geometry and efficiency metrics.

Performance metrics include horsepower and peak-rpm, which quantify engine power and efficiency. The city-mpg and highway-mpg columns measure fuel efficiency in urban and highway driving conditions, respectively, offering critical insights into the vehicle's environmental and cost efficiency. The dataset includes a critical economic feature, price, which serves as the target variable in many analyses. It allows for the exploration of relationships between price and other attributes to identify factors influencing vehicle cost. The normalized-losses column provides an index of risk assessment based on insurance claims, which can also be analyzed to determine its correlation with pricing and other features.

### DATA CLEANING

The data cleaning process for the automobile.txt dataset utilized several Python libraries and tools to prepare the data for meaningful analysis. These tools enabled efficient handling of missing values, transforming columns, and creating visual insights to ensure a structured and ready-to-use dataset:

1.	Python served as the primary programming language for implementing data cleaning and analysis tasks, offering flexibility and power for handling diverse data types.
   
3.	Pandas was employed for operations such as detecting and handling missing values, filtering rows, transforming data types, and removing duplicates. Its intuitive DataFrame structure was instrumental in performing operations on the tabular data.
   
5.	NumPy was used for numerical computations and ensuring efficient handling of missing and erroneous numerical data during transformations.
   
7.	Matplotlib and Seaborn were leveraged to create visualizations that facilitated exploratory data analysis, revealing patterns, anomalies, and distributions within the dataset.
Key Data Cleaning Steps

•	Handling Missing Values: Columns with missing data, such as price and normalized-losses, were identified and analyzed. Rows with missing or zero values in critical columns, such as price or horsepower, were removed to ensure the dataset's reliability and relevance.

•	Conversion of Data Types: Numerical columns such as price, horsepower, and engine-size were converted to appropriate numeric data types to enable mathematical operations and visualizations.

•	Removal of Irrelevant Data: Columns that did not contribute meaningfully to the analysis, such as certain redundant or overly sparse attributes, were dropped to simplify the dataset.

•	Standardization of Data: Certain columns, such as fuel-type and body-style, were standardized to consistent formats, enabling easier analysis and grouping.

•	Handling Duplicates: Duplicate entries were identified and removed to maintain data integrity.

•	Creation of New Features: Additional derived columns, such as power-to-weight ratio, were created to enhance the depth of analysis.

### VISUALIZATION FOR DATA UNDERSTANDING

•	Bar Plots: Visualized the frequency distribution of categorical attributes, such as body style and fuel type, to understand common patterns and trends in the automobile market.

•	Scatter Plots: Illustrated relationships between attributes like price and horsepower, providing insights into how performance metrics influence economic features.

•	Histograms: Used to examine the distribution of numeric attributes such as engine size, price, and compression ratio, helping identify skewness and outliers.

•	Box Plots: Highlighted variations in attributes like price across different body styles, aiding in understanding segment-specific pricing strategies.

This structured cleaning process ensured the automobile.txt dataset was free from inconsistencies and anomalies, making it well-suited for further exploration. By addressing missing data, standardizing formats, and visualizing key trends, the dataset was optimized to uncover meaningful insights into vehicle characteristics, performance, and pricing strategies in the automobile industry.

### MISSING DATA

The automobile.txt dataset contained missing data in several columns, particularly in critical features such as price, normalized-losses, and horsepower. Rows with missing values in essential columns like price were filtered out, as these are crucial for analyses involving vehicle cost and performance metrics. For columns like normalized-losses, where missing values were prevalent and difficult to impute accurately, the rows were excluded to maintain the dataset's integrity and avoid introducing bias.
By filtering out incomplete data instead of imputing or estimating values, the cleaning process ensured that the dataset remained reliable and accurate, suitable for meaningful analysis without compromising on data quality.  

### DATA STORIES AND VISUALISATIONS

Bar Chart; Consumer Preferences in Car Door Design
The bar chart illustrates the distribution of cars based on the number of doors, providing insights into consumer preferences and design trends in the automobile market. Cars with four doors dominate the dataset, reflecting their popularity for practicality and family use. In contrast, two-door vehicles, often associated with sportier models, are less frequent. The visualization highlights how the number of doors serves as a key characteristic in differentiating vehicle types and meeting diverse consumer needs.

### Scatter Plot; The Impact of Engine Size on Vehicle Pricing

The scatter plot reveals a positive correlation between engine size and vehicle price, indicating that cars with larger engines tend to be more expensive, likely due to their association with higher performance and luxury features. While smaller engine sizes exhibit a broader price range, encompassing both economy and compact premium cars, larger engines predominantly fall into higher price brackets, catering to luxury and performance markets. A few outliers deviate from the trend, suggesting niche pricing strategies or specific market anomalies. Overall, the analysis highlights engine size as a significant factor influencing vehicle pricing and market segmentation.

### Box  Plot: Impact of Body Style and Drive-Wheel Configuration on Fuel Efficiency

This visualization highlights how body style and drive-wheel configuration influence fuel efficiency. For example, sedans with front-wheel drive may appear more fuel-efficient than those with rear-wheel or four-wheel drive. Similarly, larger or heavier body styles like wagons may show lower MPG, reflecting their design trade-offs for capacity and performance. The insights from this plot can inform consumer decisions, such as choosing a vehicle with better fuel efficiency for urban use, and also provide manufacturers with trends to optimize design for specific markets.

### Bar Plot; Price Trends by Engine Location

This bar plot highlights the relationship between engine location and the average price of vehicles. Cars with rear-engine designs are often associated with luxury or performance-focused vehicles, such as sports cars, due to their rarity and the engineering complexity involved in such designs. In contrast, front-engine cars are the norm, as they are simpler and more cost-effective to manufacture.
